This project will be an SDL/OpenGL animation calibrator.

What I mean by that is that the program will open, the user will open their image files that they want to be put together into an animation, and the program will run through the files at a specified frame speed.

This speed will be variable and up to the user.

The purpose of this is to ensure that key-frame speeds are known prior to integration with an actual game or other media application.
